                    <p class="modal-paragraph"> Our final exam of Noroff first year, 
                        and perhaps our most extensive use of JavaScript to date. 
                        Our brief was to create a blog site hosted by wordpress, 
                        and to fetch the data via an API call. 
                        The site could be on anything we chose, 
                        but had specific pages and functionality that we were required to include- 
                        I chose to make a peaceful, 
                        sleepy tea blog that also sold teacups
                        to go with the posts on serving and enjoying the perfect brew.
                        The purpose of the site is purely informative and entertaining- 
                        all about tea- its history, how England stole it, 
                        its cultural, artistic and social significance, 
                        how it has shaped countries, literature and the class systems, 
                        its many health benefits and how to brew the perfect cup. 
                        On top of this I had planned on adding a shop 
                        section so you could buy the perfect cup to go with your 
                        edification.</p>

                    <p class="modal-paragraph"> The first exam of our school year- 
                        This was a build of purely HTML and CSS, as we had not yet completed our JavaScript 1 module.
                        The brief was to build a website for a community science museum for children and young adults, 
                        to invite them to visit and display the exhibits .
                        In its essence the exercise was to test our CSS and HTML skills- 
                        the brief itself was a child and young person-friendly, 
                        community science museum- 
                        To advertise the exhibits and special events that the museum was showing, 
                        what facilities were available for visiting schools and to let people know the location of the museum itself.</p>

                        The main purpose of this site was to advertise and sell games at competitive prices, 
                        to be able to view them and their specific details and to add them to your cart.
