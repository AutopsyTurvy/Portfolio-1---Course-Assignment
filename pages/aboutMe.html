<p class="about-paragraph"> 
    Hello there! Welcome, welcome!
    <br>
    My name is Kitty (Or Alice, if you like!) - I am a Front End Development student at Noroff school in Norway!
    <br>
    Coding was a life changing decision after many years spent as an artist, and I find the creative potential so exciting!
    The journey from paper to pixels was a huge jump for me, especially as someone who is habitually described as "Victorian" by 
    friends and teachers, but now I stand before you, a thoroughly chaotic, but passionate Front-End Development Student!
    <br>
    So far I've had the privilege of diving into HTML, CSS, JavaScript- but I wait with baited breath to also delve into 
    other frameworks that can expand my toolkit and allow me to bring my creative visions to life -- I expect my educational journey, 
    and following career to be one of constant growth and endless curiosity.
    Despite what feels like a short first year, we have already completed three projects, 
    and are looking forward to the next twelve months of increasing skill and knowledge.
    I enjoy trying to incorperate illustration into my work, and intend to develop this as my education progresses
     -Hopefully with more and more finesse! I aim to further refine my skills and contribute to projects that make 
    the digital world a more inclusive, beautiful, and engaging place. 
    
    <p class="about-paragraph">
    <br>
    I still keep my artwork close by, of course... if I get a break from schoolwork I still dust off the pencils or sewing machine. 
    I can't be sitting at a desk all day with out quilts, blankets, cosy artwork or comfortable dresses, can I?
    I also recently started dipping into animation!  

    <br>
    Let's Connect!
    I'm always on the lookout for new challenges, collaborations, and opportunities to learn, and as I learn best through 
    connection with others, why not reach out?
